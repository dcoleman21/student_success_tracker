Alexander Klick,1,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"You’ve come a long way since this time last inning; I’m really glad to hear you’ve identified your roles/skills in a team setting. I can tell you’ve been practicing speaking up and growing your confidence. 
Another skill I think you have developed lately is the ability to stay focused and prioritize tasks, etc.
If you feel you’ve been diving deep or working very differently from others on your team, you can make that time even more productive by documenting your learnings and sharing them with your peers.",,
Amanda McGuire,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"You’ve really demonstrated a solid growth mindset throughout mod 2. You also have a good grasp on rails conventions and other technical material that we covered.
I’d really like to see your confidence more closely reflect your skill level. Turing is a great place to practice the skill of speaking up more often and taking initiative on your team.",,
Antonio King,1,2,2,1,1,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,YES,YES,NO,PASS,YES,YES,Pass,,"You've really shown determination and an eye for good code this inning. Keep working on ActiveRecord, refactoring old work, and finding code to read. Even bad code can teach you something! Don't let the ""curse of the competent"" trip you going forward. Your Networking skills are excellent, and I can't wait to see the rest of your career at Turing.",,
Brett Jones,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"I appreciate your reflections on teamwork. I’m glad to hear the DTR process was something you stuck with and that it set your teams up for success.
Talking about your capacity to share knowledge across teams— this would be good to highlight in interviews. I’m glad to hear your confidence has grown IRT telling your professional story, keep practicing! Keep in mind that code challenges aren’t always about getting to a solution, but about seeing your problem solving process. ",,
Brian Fletcher,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"It sounds like you did a really good job of implementing the feedback you received from cohort-mates. As you go through Turing, I’d suggest taking inventory of what exactly made that feedback helpful since you’ll be expected to provide more and more feedback for your teammates as you progress.
Consider asking quieter teammates for their input. Even if you don’t implement their suggestions, it can go a long way in helping them feel included.",,
Carina Sweet,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,YES,NO,PASS,YES,NO,Pass,,"So proud of you! You've come a long way, both in coding and confidence. Keep setting expectations and, of course, tackling the fun that is ActiveRecord.",,
Caroline Tan,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"I’d encourage you to keep advocating for yourself/your learning through boundaries and planning work with your team(s) ahead of time.
It’s great to hear that you were able to process that feedback about reading docs, and consider better ways to dig through new material. Often, hands-on practice and expermintation is just as valuable as reading and studying.
I really like the idea of utilizing an agile workflow for ‘human problems’ not just technical work.",,
Dane Brophy,0,1,2,1,0,2,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,YES,YES,NO,PASS,YES,YES,Pass,,You've come a long way this inning technically. Continue to practice a growth mindset and being okay with not knowing all the answers before you start the work. Great job identifying ways to improve communication on a larger team.,,
DeAndre Hill,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"Always impressed by your questions and additions to lessons, conversations, and projects. You always look for new solutions, and outside the lessons -- a mark of a great developer. Going forward, spend some time on ActiveRecord and thinking about ways to get more feedback even when you feel comfortable with your code.",,
elliot olbright,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"As we discussed, spending more time on ActiveRecord and SQL during the break is a great use of that time. Also think about DRY code -- I recommend looking back at some of your earliest submissions and thinking through how you might make it more DRY. You'll be surprised how much you know now. Keep being the organizer in your groups, as it's a role that will get you far both in Turing and in your career. I look forward to seeing the rest of your Turing career! ",,

Gunnar Runkle,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,Really impressed by your progress! Spend some time over intermission with ActiveRecord and thinking about how to make your code DRYer. Read examples of code from other Turing students -- how are they writing their code? It won't be your style of coding (everyone has their own) but it will help you develop your own. Proud of you! Keep being the morale booster.,,
Jacob Martinez,0,2,2,2,1,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,YES,NO,PASS,YES,NO,Pass,,"You have a good understanding of everything we covered in Mod 2 and I’m looking forward to seeing how you apply that knowledge. Don’t feel like you have to be an expert on a topic before speaking on or implementing it; you’re not expected to have all the answers, just a solid process and the ability to speak to what you build.
I’d recommend reflecting more about your team experience to identify any strategies that made you successful.
I appreciate the mindful approach to gear up and how you really honor everyone’s lived experiences.
What an awesome vision for your career— data security is such important work. You can really impact a lot of people’s live for the better.",,
Jacob Piland,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"Up front planning seems to be a strength of yours and seems to have been good for your team dynamics. I agree that there’s no rush to jump into implementation, communication is a much higher priority.
I appreciate that you’re being intentional and present in regards to Gear Up and other difficult conversations. It’s easy to go through the motions which doesn’t help anyone, so it’s great to hear you’re approaching that mindfully.",,
Jason Knoll,1,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,Great job tackling the sheer amount of new material. Your curious mindset is an asset in that way. I’m happy to hear that the team project helped connect some of these dots and provide really useful practice on these concepts.

I’d encourage you to practice advocating for yourself while still at Turing; it’s a skill you can get more comfortable just like the technical coding skills.",,
Lee Hopper,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"I’m very impressed with what you’ve learned and built in mod 2. I also really appreciate that you recognize your teams contributions and their various strengths. 
Thank you for your contributions to Gear Up; I think these are great spaces to practice the potentially difficult conversations you’d like to have at your workplace someday.
You’ve definitely implemented the feedback from mod 1 in your final project. I think that served you very well.",,
Marla Schulz,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"You're awesome, Marla! You're in the ideal place to start reading any and all code: your old code, others' code, etc. Refactor your old solutions; you'll be surprised how much you've learned. And contribute to an open-source project! Thanks for always being a morale booster, but don't forget to set your own boundaries. ",,
Matt Toensing,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"I appreciate the hard work you've put in this mod -- and it shows from how far you've grown. Keep working on ActiveRecord and MVC, and push yourself by refactoring some of your older projects. ",,
Matthew Kragen,1,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"Keep asking these great questions! 
Opening up conversation with your team, getting other perspectives, is a great way to start a project.
You’re a very strong independent learner/contributor. Turing is a good place to practice working in a more collaborative environment, since as you move into mods 3/4 there will be a lot of chances to collaborate like you would in the workplace.",,
Michael Abbott,1,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"Spend some time thinking through MVC architecture over the break, and of course, ActiveRecord. And look into meet-ups!

Samantha Peterson,1,2,2,2,0,2,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,YES,NO,PASS,YES,NO,Pass,,"There’s a strong a theme of developer empathy throughout all of your reflections, and this is a great skill to focus on. It helps you write more resilient code but more importantly ties into the agency you have to impact the industry for the better.
Asking lots of questions won’t hold your team back— you might be surprised how much everyone learns when you ‘rewind’ and clarify things.
One of my favorite pieces of advice is in line with what you’re describing: ‘own it til you hone it’",,
Scott Borecki,2,2,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"Thanks for offering so many creative solutions to problems this cohort. Check out open-source projects, both to contribute to and to read. Tackle some advanced Active Record over the intermission if you can.",,
Taylor Varoglu,2,2,2,2,1,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,YES,NO,PASS,YES,NO,Pass,,"You're a strong student ready to tackle Mod 3! I appreciate that you're always looking to be a leader while letting others lead or find their voice. You're in a great position to be a leader in that as well: initiate conversations about others' code, especially when they're struggling. It's often easier to ask them their thought process, what they've done so far to solve the problem, or just to read their code out loud vs handing them the solution. Great job working on MVC and DRY code.",,

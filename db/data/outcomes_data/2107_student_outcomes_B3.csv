Alex Ferencz,2,2,2,1,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,YES,NO,NO,PASS,YES,NO,Pass,,"It’s really great to hear that you’ve made the realization that you don’t need to lose yourself and what you’re passionate about when coming into this field. Originally, you chose to come to Turing to make a better salary, and you thought you’d be risking the items you were so passionate about, and I love that you now know that that does not need to be the case! Going into the job hunt, know that you are a very capable developer. You are ready to start applying. Keep working on your technical talk — record yourself, replay it, talk through your implementation with peers/instructors/mentors and give them permission to correct your language when you could have said something different. Good job this mod, you grew a lot, and excited for you to go to mod 4.",,
Alicia Henzler,1,0,2,1,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,YES,NO,NO,PASS,YES,NO,Pass,,"Know that you are very capable of being here. Your learning trajectory, like you said, was a bit ‘slow to go fast’, and that is totally okay! Your progress is unique to you, and your learning style and the speed in which you learn does not need to be identical to anyone else’s. I say this to remind you to be careful in comparing yourself to others — your trajectory was different, but you’re just as capable to go on to mod 4 as anyone else that is going on to mod 4. Practice your technical talk — rubber duck, talk to others, explain your implementation/design decisions to someone.",,

I really love hearing you say that at the end of mod 3, you've been able to catch yourself saying 'hmm... i don't know how to do that, but i can figure it out'. That's the goal! I am really glad to see that you have the confidence in your ability. Glad to hear that you will be starting the interview process this week -- don't hesitate to apply to jobs just to get experience.

You've consistently shown that you are capable of tackling any of the technical challenges we've thrown at you, and I believe you'll continue to do that on the job. Your reflections on teamwork and project management are valuable not only here at Turing but also on the job hunt. Use that to sell yourself to potential employers ",,
Andrew Shafer,1,2,1,2,1,,1,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,YES,YES,PASS,YES,YES,Pass,,"Good job this inning, Andrew. It was really great to see you come up with a plan for your repeat of mod 3, and follow through with gaining more understanding in the areas you knew you’d like to grow in. I’ve really appreciated the perspective you’ve brought to gear ups this inning, always challenging people to think from different angles. I would like to encourage you to continue working on your technical talk, and presenting your project/code. Remember to focus on higher level, and allow people to ask you more specific questions if they’d like to. It can be very hard to follow your implementation when you talk through it at a very granular level before talking at a broader level (think, focus on oop principles, pillars of oop, etc.)",,
Caleb Wittman,2,1,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"Make sure you are managing burnout as you enter mod 4. It's great that you have so many things that you are excited to tackle, just make sure you are also making time to rest and take care of yourself.",,

I remember talking with you in th ebeginning of the mod about how excited you were to be working with and building api’s. I didn’t realize that was the whole reason why you chose backend in the first place! Thank you for making the time to connect with us as instructors (squishies), and sometimes stepping into a manger role within your projects. You’re very capable of being here, and excited to see what you do come mod 4 and after.",,

Kon Ham,2,0,2,2,2,,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,NO,NO,PASS,NO,NO,Pass,,"Kon, really great having you back this inning. You’ve always been someone that has brought great levity to classes, and any space that you exist in. You mentioned empathy as one of your super powers, and I would second that. I know you’ve been someone that has given so much time to others, making sure everyone feels cared for and heard. You don’t shy away from hard conversations, and you also share your opinion freely while also being open to learning others. You are a great member of any team.",,

It’s evident you brought the same level of clarity and communication that you have with us, with your own teammates. I appreciate your reflection on trusting your own abilities, taking a step back, and realizing how far you’ve come — I think that this will also help you build your confidence in your abilities.",,
Meaghan (Emmy) Morris,1,2,1,2,0,2,2,PASS,PASS,PASS,NO,YES,NO,PASS,YES,NO,Pass,,"I really appreciate your reflection on the feedback you got throughout this inning. It seems like confidence has been a big theme of your feedback, and I’m glad that you are making efforts to help build your confidence. I think one way you can do that is by doing your own research and implementation before asking questions — prove to yourself that YOU can do this. I know you’re nervous headed into the job search, and framing your experience as professional experience. Utilize Ryan as much as you can to talk through this, and leverage all the job resources you can in Mod 4.",,

Your strength and your motivation to succeed and be here at Turing is admirable. You mentioned that you frequently ask yourself ‘im trying as hard as i can, buttt… can I try harder?’. I’d caution you to be careful with this mentality , as it can sometimes lead to not giving yourself grace when needing down time, and just needing to be human. And yes, I agree, ‘feedback IS a form of love’ ;) .. I love this! Your perspective on growing as a person as well as a teammate is so great to hear.",,

It’s obvious to me that you are very welcoming of feedback, and I appreciate your vulnerability in talking through the areas that you know you need to focus on to be the best you and the best teammate you can be. You had this saying ‘do well where I’m needed’, and I think that’s a great approach to the job, since you won’t always have a say on what you work on. But, while you’re in turing, feel free to speak up for your learning, and advocate for your learning and were you’d like focus your time and energy. Happy you came back!",,

Looking forward to seeing you and your group at Demo comp!",,

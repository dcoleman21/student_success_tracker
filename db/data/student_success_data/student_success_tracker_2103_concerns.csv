1,,1,1,,FE,1,Beth Meeker,"Week 1
Repeater - Could have soft passed into 2, but chose to repeat, no concerns, great attitude

Week 4
Got far on midmods, but did not implement good habits",,,,,Yes,,,,,
3,,3,2,,FE,1,Darla Evans,"Week 1
Repeater - Struggled with committment and time management last inning, didn't do anything over intermission, very shy and afraid to speak up

Week 3
Seeing a lot of enthusiasm from other repeaters; Not from Darla. Not asking questions. Need to see paired project to see how she's doing. Not ready with coldcalled. Last inning she was not giving turing the time it needs. Will ask about this in squishees

Week 4
Did great on midmods. Will had one concerning conversations when Darla was trying to pass a simple test (is an object). ",,,,,Yes,,,,,
1,,1,2,,FE,1,Steven Berg,"Week 1
Repeater - Could have soft passed into 2, but didn't finish final project, needs support with data model vs DOM, needs support with time management

Week 4
Did not pass all tests for mid mods. Did not show good problem solving strategies (no console logging, pseudocoding). Encourge him to do mock assessment",,,,,Yes,,,,,
2,,1,2,,FE,1,Eva Navarrete,"Week 1
Repeater - ESL, has named that language barrier gets in the way, has grown a lot with advocating for herself and asking questions, did not grab much content from first inning, puts in the time and is very driven

Week 4
Had lots of bugs in her solo challenge. Encourage her to sign up for student hours this week.",,,,,Yes,,,,,
1,,1,2,,FE,1,Farangiz Akhatova,"Week 1
Repeater - super driven, asks tons of questions, ESL, might be overdoing it - keep an eye on this

Week 4
Pattern matching in midmods. Has mock assessment scheduled with Heather. Named that she wants help with conditionals and math. ",,,,,Yes,,,,,
,,3,3,,FE,1,Andrey Bermudez,"Week 3
ESL. Has recognized that he needs to ask questions sooner, but has not changed anything. Live transcript is awesome. Working very hard. Remind him to ask for help. Praise when he does!

Week 4
Pretty good on midmod, almost to passing test. If solo challenge is concerning, tell them to come to student hours",,,,,,,,,,
,,4,3,,FE,1,Hayley Witherell,"Week 3
Taryn mentioned concerns about Hayley's progress through mythicals. Hayley also mentioned that they don't like to preteach concepts and they wait until the lesson occurs before getting to that topic in the project. Doesn't seem like Hayley sees the concerns. Is completing the same creature more than once - would lead to pattern matching. Group project concerns if Hayley doesn't want to preteach. 

Week 4
Solo challenge looked good. Midmod was concerning and did not take feedback well.",,,,,,,,,,
,,3,3,,FE,1,Em Orendorff,"Week 3
Very bad midmod. Big misunderstandings on parameters and arguments. Got direct feedback during midmod about how and what to practice.

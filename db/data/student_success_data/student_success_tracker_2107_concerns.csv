4,4,2,,,FE,2,Andrey Bermudez,"Week One
- Andrey's medical concerns are continuing. He is currently in Mexico recieving health care. He is living with his family and occassionally encounters unreliable internet 
- 7/12 will have a medical check in
- Will have surgery the weekend of Week 3. It should be only a few days of recovery time
- His first solo project (flashcards) was not a pass. The game is missing the final message to report the score. It errors instead. Looking back at notes, he also needed an extension for this same project last inning. Repeaters were required to do an additional bulletpoint which he did not attempt.

Week two:
His solo project was a fail 
-He reached out on Monday about his surgery being postpond to Monday morning, he couldn't attend the class, We reached out to him to have a call with him on Tuesday

- Shayan sent Kayla a message about some anxieties he's been having, and how they lead him to consider leaving Turing early. He seems to be feeling better about it, but the messages will be documented in the M3 channel
- Failed his mid mod 
- App broken on load, fetching data from the api, but only console.logging it, never setting it to state, hard coding state with the assumed response from API
- Met with Shayan 07/22 and he is definitely still hard on himself, or over analyzing his interactions with others, he left with some good strategies to help him with this, and seems to be in a good place
- while his mid-mod didn't show it, Shayan seems to feel confident in his abilities, and said he would really hit the reps on idea boxes.
Week 4
- Shayan sent Kayla and I a message to let us know he was considering a LOA
- We gave him all the details and confirmed his understanding that he would be on his last shot of M3 should he go this route
- We discussed some pros / cons and told that he should focus only on the required piece of M3 should he want to continue - he agreed he would, but then went to an optional lesson *shrug*

,,4,2,2,BE,2,Jacob Martinez,"Week 3
Jacob felt behind IRT the solo project, and left the cohort culture gear up early (saying he was not in a good place mentally to contribute).
He has met with Kelly twice this week over zoom and both times has seemed to be in a rough place emotionally. We have encouraged him to schedule time with Jun. 
He has met with George but told instructors ""he didn't get along with George and so doesn't feel comfortable working with her as a tutor""
Week 4
Jacob did very well on the mid-mod. We also met with him and found out his issue with tutoring was that George did not give him feedback on the area he was hoping to focus on, and generally did not give him much critical feedback. We recommended a few studying strategies for the learning goals he was most concerned about.",,,,,,,,,,

,2,1,2,,FE,1,Sarah Rudy,"Week 2: 
She was a BE student last inning and is now in FEM1. She is asking great questions in class that indicate that she's keeping up, but her first project was not passing. I expected someone with an inning of Turing under her belt to get farther. Context from BE: She was on track to repeat M1 in BE. Mike has concerns about why she switched programs and that she might be under the impression that it'll be easier here. ""If I had to give a reason why their first project didnt go well I would say they are thinking they can get away with a lower amount of work and are just not putting in the work.""
